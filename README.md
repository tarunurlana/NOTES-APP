# NOTES-APP
Note is a note-taking app for the web. You can use the demo app at https://tarunurlana.github.io/NOTES-APP/. In this note app, users can easily add, edit, or delete their notes. It is a static site without a database so that they wonâ€™t remove on page refresh or tab close, and it is done with pure JavaScript.
